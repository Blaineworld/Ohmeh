# Ohmeh
*The active smart planner.*

---

Ohmeh is an idea I just came up with while I was watching a video about
executive functioning. What was I doing&hellip;?

Oh!

Ohmeh is a smart planner similar to any other planner you might have
used. (I haven't tried to use any.) Ohmeh is named after its two core
features, which are the **Oh!** and **Meh&hellip;** options.

**Oh!** is accessible at any time and allows you to quickly and easily
add a new task that you forgot to add didn't realize you needed to do,
or were simply unaware of. This means you don't have to spend all that
energy simply writing a to-do list and remembering all the things you
have to do. Instead, you can log whatever you do remember, and add
anything else you remember at the time when you remember it.

**Meh&hellip;** allows you to postpone tasks so you can do them later
when you actually feel like doing them.

Ohmeh shows you a small selection of tasks at a time, which are chosen
based on a variety of factors such as how you rated the difficulty of
the task, the actual nature of the task, the time you set for it,
and (possibly) your real-world location.

Once you have completed a task, simply select **Done!**
